# PicoCTF: Some Assembly Required 

This README contains writeups for all levels of Some Assembly Required. Because levels 1 and 2 are quite simple, I've only breifly described those levels and have written more in-depth explanations for levels 3 and 4.
- [Level 1](http://mercury.picoctf.net:26318/index.html)
- [Level 2](http://mercury.picoctf.net:61778/index.html)
- [Level 3](http://mercury.picoctf.net:47240/index.html)

## Context (all levels)

We are provided with a URL that brings us to a very simple site that prompts us to enter a flag. We are given no source code or hints. This is the same for all levels.

## Background Information: WebAssembly (all levels)

WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary format for executable files that aims to make low-level programs in C, C++, and Rust more portable and used in web environments. Web Assembly Text Format (WAT) is the human-readable version of WASM. It is easy to read and resembles the register-by-register format of other assembly languages.

```WAT
export function strcmp(a:int, b:int):int { // func1
  var c:int = g_a;
  var d:int = 32;
  var e:int = c - d;
  e[6]:int = a;
  e[5]:int = b;
  var f:int = e[6]:int;
  e[4]:int = f;
  var g:int = e[5]:int;
  e[3]:int = g;
  ...
```

A useful tool for dealing with WASM and WAT files is [this WASM decompiler by Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen). This gives access to a useful WASM to WAT decompiler command:

`wasm-decompile input.wasm -o output.wat`

Another useful tool is the [Web Assembly Toolkit](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt). I found this one to be less helpful for this challenge, but it's nice to have on hand!

Web Assembly files can "export" certain functions/variables to be accessed in other scripts, like in JavaScript:

```WAT
export global input:int = 1072;
export global key:int = 1067;
```

## Vulnerability (all levels)

To gather more information, I decided to inspect the website. Navigating to the Networks tab, I found a couple of interesting things.

<img src="images-sar1234/level-1-network-analysis.png" width="1000" />

We see an executable file being used by the site, as well as a JavaScript file. 

Note: To see the files for each level, navigate to the level's subdirectory. The JavaScript file can be used for levels 1 and 2, but I was able to solve those levels without it, and therefore they are not included in the level subdirectories.

## Exploitation: Level 1

To try to see what the exectable may do, I decided to `curl` it by doing `curl http://mercury.picoctf.net:26318/JIFxzHyW8W > exec`. To get more information about what kind of executable this is, I did `file exec`:

`exec.wasm: WebAssembly (wasm) binary module version 0x1 (MVP)`

We see the binary is a WebAssembly file, thus I renamed `exec` to `exec.wasm`. I also ran `strings exec.wasm` to try to get more information, and that's where I found the flag:

```text
madalinastoicov@Madalinas-MacBook-Air-2 level-1 % strings exec.wasm
memory
__wasm_call_ctors
strcmp
check_flag
input
copy_char

__dso_handle
__data_end
__global_base
__heap_base
__memory_base

__table_base
 
 j!
  F!!A
!" ! "q!# #
!% $ %q!& 
!( ' (q!) & )k!* 
!+ +
+picoCTF{8857462f9e30faae4d037e5e25fee1ce}
```

## Exploitation: Level 2

I tried doing the same process as level 1: grabbing the executable and running `strings` on it. However, I see that that the flag seems to be encoded this time: 

`xakgK\5cNs((j:l9<mimk?:k;9;8=8?=0?>jnn:j=lu`

Before doing some more advanced decoding, I tried running this string through some basic decoders on CyberChef. After a couple of attempts and different schemes, I found that the flag is XORd:

<img src="images-sar1234/level2-XOR.png" width="600" />

## Exploitation: Level 3

I started solving this level by executing the same steps as levels 1 and 2: grab the executable by using `curl` and running `strings`. For this part, we don't see anything that may resemble a flag:

```text
madalinastoicov@Madalinas-MacBook-Air-2 level-3 % strings exec.wasm
memory
__wasm_call_ctors
strcmp
check_flag
input
copy_char

__dso_handle
__data_end
__global_base
__heap_base
__memory_base

__table_base
 
 j!
  F!!A
!" ! "q!# #
!% $ %q!& 
!( ' (q!) & )k!* 
!+ +
 
 t!
 
 u!
```

We realize we need to get more information to solve this level. Recall that WebAssembly binaries can be decompiled to WAT formats to be more easily read:

`wasm-decompile exec.wasm -o decompiled_wasm.wat`

Indeed, we see a more human-readable assembly-like format (see `level-3/decompiled_wasm.wat` for complete source code). Before taking the time to analyze the WAT file, I also decided to look at the JavaScript we found earlier.

The raw JavaScript (seen in `level-3/src.js`) is obfuscated and very hard to read. I started by passing it into a [JavaScript deobfuscator](https://deobfuscate.io/) and then manually deobfuscated. I realized the array given at the beginning of the file represented the strings needed to fill in the rest of the file. The (mostly) deobfuscated JavaScript can be found at `level-3/src_clean.js`. This is what we see is happening in the file:

- A function grabs the first element of the given array of strings
- A function rotates the members of the array until a certain stopping condition is met. This stopping condition is when a certain algorithm determined by a series of parsed strings matches the passed in integer.
- A function fetches the Web Assembly code corresponding with the challenge and grabs its exports.
- A function that we see in the source HTML (onButtonPress) grabs the user's input flag, performs a `copy_char` function on it for its entire length, and then performs a `check_flag` operation on it. Both of these external functions are referred to with "exports", so we know we must refer to the WASM/WAT file to see what those functions do.

Next we analyze the `decompiled_wasm.wat` file and find the following:
- We have a memory region assigned `global g_a:int = 66864;`
- We also have input and key memory regions:`export global input:int = 1072; export global key:int = 1067;`
- The data stored in those input and key regions is shown:
```WAT
data d_nA372e6(offset: 1024) =
  "\9dn\93\c8\b2\b9A\8b\94\c6\df3\c0\c5\95\de7\c3\9f\93\df?\c9\c3\c2\8c2\93"
  "\90\c1\8ee\95\9f\c2\8c6\c8\95\c0\90\00\00"; //flag
data d_b(offset: 1067) = "\f1\a7\f0\07\ed"; //key
```
- There are some basic `strcmp` and `check_flag` functions.
- There is a `copy` flag, which we see performs some specific operations to its inputs. We realize that this what `copy_char` was referencing in the JavaScript file. Therefore, that means that this is the string scrambling function performed on the flag data specified above.

Our task is to analyze this `copy` function and perform the same operations on the flag data.

```WAT
function copy(a:int, b:int) { // func3
  var c:int = g_a;
  var d:int = 16;
  var e:int_ptr = c - d;
  e[3] = a;
  e[2] = b;
  var f:int = e[3];
  if (eqz(f)) goto B_a;
  var g:int = 4;
  var h:int = e[2];
  var i:int = 5;
  var j:int = h % i;
  var k:ubyte_ptr = g - j;
  var l:int = k[1067];
  var m:int = 24;
  var n:int = l << m;
  var o:int = n >> m;
  var p:int = e[3];
  var q:int = p ^ o;
  e[3] = q;
  label B_a:
  var r:int = e[3];
  var s:byte_ptr = e[2];
  s[1072] = r;
}
```

After analyzing the WAT file, we find that the `copy` function does the following:

[WORK IN PROGRESS]

## Exploitation: Level 4

[WORK IN PROGRESS]

## Remediation

A vulnerability we see here is that critical information is not secured, and therefore can be easily seen amongst the rest of a binary file. One way to prevent this could be encrypting this data. Or, not making the binary file available to the client is also an option.
